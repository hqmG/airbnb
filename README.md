## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code is developed using Python version 3.9.7 and a virtual environment. Please install the libraries listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/hqmG/airbnb/blob/main/requirements.txt) to run the code with no issues.


## Project Motivation<a name="project_motivation"></a>

For this project, I used the [Airbnb Seattle Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) from 2016 to examine the following questions:

1. When is the most expensive time to visit?
2. Which are the most popular areas?
3. What features affects the price the most?


## File Descriptions <a name="file_descriptions"></a>

There is one notebook [project.ipynb](https://github.com/hqmG/airbnb/blob/main/notebooks/project.ipynb) implemented to answer the questions above. In addition, there is a [src](https://github.com/hqmG/airbnb/tree/main/src) folder including utility functions, e.g. to process and visualize data.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The result of the code is available in the post [What To Think About When Booking An Airbnb Visit?](https://medium.com/@hqm.gronvall/what-to-think-about-when-booking-an-airbnb-visit-f92ef4b2499b).
