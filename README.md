## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code is developed using Python version 3.9.7 and the libraries listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/hqmG/airbnb/blob/main/requirements.txt).


## Project Motivation<a name="project_motivation"></a>

For this project, I used the [Airbnb Seattle Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) from 2016 to examine the following questions:

1. Which are the most popular areas?
2. When is the most expensive time to visit?
3. What features affects the price the most?


## File Descriptions <a name="file_descriptions"></a>

There is one notebook [project.ipynb]() implemented to answer the questions above. There is an additional [src]() folder including an utility library, e.g. to load and visualize data.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The result of the code is available in the post []().


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit to Airbnb for the data. Licensing for the data and other descriptive information can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). Otherwise, feel free to use the code.
